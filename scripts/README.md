- shared_polymorphisms.R: it calculates the shared SNPs

- PCA out of vcf code.R: it uses any vcf file and makes a PCA out of it (SNPRelate)

- from_fP_to_different_alleles_ok.R: it takes output of fastPHASE, generates allelic trees and calculates their probabilities (P-allelic)

 - PtoD_calculation_revision_ok.R: it calculates PtoD for all genes in each species (and different species comparisons)

- pi_contig_11.R: is an example. It is used to visualize pi for the three species. The same type of script can be used to produce figure from S7 to S18 included (Tajima's D, Fst, betascore).
